This fork contains support for MIPS32 architrecture in [mcsema](https://github.com/lifting-bits/mcsema)

Notes: 

- To recover individual hardware instructions, we switch off IDA-Pro's capability to combine instructions to improve readability(Macro instruction(Assembler idioms or Pseudo instructions). To have that change, use [ida.cfg](scripts/ida.cfg) provided in this repo. This is the configuration file for IDA-Pro with the required changes.
Paste this in `/path/to/ida-installation/cfg/`
Without the ida.cfg file, the code is not guranteed to work.

- Initially, we started working with McSema's version for IDA-Pro 7.3, but later ported it for IDA-pro 7.6. We still maintain compatibility such that the CFG recovery works with both IDA-pro 7.3 and 7.6.
 
- However, incase the CFG recovery still fails due to CFG recovery scripts not being compatible with the version of IDA-pro you have installed, refer to [this link)(idaprort) and make changes in the scripts as required. The scripts in questions are located at `tools/mcsema/tools/mcsema_disass/ida7`

- To visualize the data recovered in the .cfg file, use [vis_cfg_2.py](scripts/vis_cfg_2.py).
to use:
```
 python vis_cfg_2.py bin.cfg
```
where `bin.cfg` is your .cfg file generate by `mcsema_disass`. This creates a .dot file for each recoverd function.
To view: `display main.dot`. Here `main.dot` is the .dot file generated by the script.
